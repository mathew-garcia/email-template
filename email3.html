        Hello Patrick,<br><br>I'm going to have to disappear as I lost a member of my family last night. I have moved
        meetings and asked others to cover things that can't be moved. I believe everything is in hand, but will keep my
        mobile on just in case of emergencies. Please accept my apologies and I'll be back on Monday.
        <br><br>Regards,<br> Mary
    </p>
