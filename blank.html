        Patrick,<br><br> Sounds like you had a great night. I will
        extend
        your paper deadline to <code>Wednesday at 11:59 PM</code>. It must be submitted to
        <code>turnitin.com</code><br><br>Please refer to my sallabus for information on how to
        submit your paper. I appreciate your concedrn for my bald head. My wife likes it and
        I
        don't get paid enough to get hair implants. <br><br>On a side note... What were you
        drinking
        last night? Next time you email me I'd like a bottle of whatever you had so I don't
        have
        to remember what you said. <br><br>Good yard <br>- Mr. Martin
    </p>
